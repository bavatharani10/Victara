                <h2>Our Certificates and Online programes for 2025</h2>
                <p>The university and the college provides exams in a scheduled format and provide a study gap after each exams. It provides knowledge for the students to prepare for real world applications.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In can improve by including more practical knowledge. The exams are little difficult but the time for study is provided. And due to the difficulty in exam will provide better graduates The campus placement are usually provided in our college is for final year students. The placements are provided in different companies like ultra tech, Hilite builders ect. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The companies provides packages about 20000 and it may varies depends on the companies. Almost 90 percentage students are placed from our college.he companies like d & e global consulting LLP, BIM labs ect are provided the internship for the college students . It provides the practical knowledge for students to overcome the real work field and clarity about their job</p>
                 <br>
                <p>My plan after degree is continue with the college placement. Campus life is enjoyable. Even when there aren't many students at the college, it can be difficult to run a program like art, sports, etc. We make it more enjoyable and enjoy every moment of it, even if we are running a program. The NSS claims that students must do a lot of social work, which we enjoy, including cleaning the college and going to senior living homes. A library has all the books you need to read and learn.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It's a peaceful and quiet place to read and study. There, you can enjoy the books and read. We have a tech show called INNERVE in 2022 and 2023.It is an amazing experience. The onam celebration and ethnic day are also conducted in our college.</p>
                <br>
                <p>According to the faculty-to-student ratio, which may be between 1 and 10, some of the faculties have good relationships with their students, while others do not. I can't remember which faculties I liked because they were kind and diligent teachers who tried their best to help their students pass by teaching them in every way possible, while others were rude and self-centered and only cared about themselves. There are no longer any difficult exams; in fact, all subjects are simple if you study, even though many students fail exams but pass them in the upcoming tests.</p>
